# Auto-login into moodle.iiit.ac.in
This script has been written specifically for Safari browser using Selenium on Python. Browser drivers can be changed in the code itself. This login method is also possible for other sites on portals.iiit.ac.in as well.

# Steps to run the script
1. Download the script
2. Create your own ".moodle_creds" in the same directory as the script
3. Run with "python3 moodle.py"

Obviously, I'm lazy, but you can't blame me for having ridiculously long login credentials. xD
